  <h3>History of FC Bayern Munich</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Through World War II</strong>- The club was formed in 1900 when a number of football enthusiasts split from Münchner TurnVerein 1879 to escape the influence of the club's gymnasts, who did not hold a great enthusiasm for the new game, an attitude typical of the times in Germany.</li>
    
   <li><strong>Transition years 1946–1962</strong>-After World War II, Bayern played in the Oberliga Süd, which was one of five upper league conferences established in the western half of the country. Through the period from the formation of the Oberligen in 1947 to the creation of the Bundesliga, Germany's professional league, in 1963, they played as a middling side.</li>
   
   <li><strong>Early successes in the Bundesliga</strong>-With the beginning of the 1963–64 season, the first German division—which until then had been split into five regional divisions—was unified into one national league, the Bundesliga.</li>
   <li><strong>1972 – the watershed</strong>-In the last match of the 1971–72 season, Bayern sealed their return to Germany's top with a 5–1 win against Schalke 04. Schalke needed a win to get the title but only ended up the best runner-up in Bundesliga history. This was also Bayern's first official match in the new Olympic Stadium. The sell-out crowd of 80,000 assured the club the first gate in excess a 1,000,000 Marks.</li>
    <li><strong>Renewed success in the 1980s</strong>-A lack of success saw President Neudecker on the verge of contracting Max Merkel as new coach – the team unanimously voted against him. This novel type of revolution saw Bayern dominating the television news in a culture where sports were an irregular addendum to them.</li>
    <li><strong>Beginning of the new millennium</strong>The next six years for Bayern would be marked by enormous success. It was the time when Ottmar Hitzfeld succeeded Udo Lattek as most successful German coach, even finding a spot for himself amongst the greatest European coaches of all time.</li>
